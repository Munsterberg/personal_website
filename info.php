        <h1>The Process!</h1>
        <h2>THE BRIEF</h2>
        <p>The brief is the most important phase. I will usually meet with the client to go over many detailed
        questions. This part is often overlooked by a lot of freelance developers, but it ensures you will
        receive the correct product with no surprises. Another option is to email the document of questions
        to the client. The document contains full instructions and guides you through the entire process.
         I suggest going as in depth as possible on the answers, I am not lying when I say
        this is the most important phase!</p>
        <h2>THE SKELETON</h2>
        <p>The second phase is quite extensive, and can take anywhere from a day to a couple of months,
        depending on the size and complexity of the project. There are a lot of small details in this step,
        but the short story is just a lot of communication between the developer and client. This is known
        at agencies as the "designer phase". The client will be in close contact with the designer throughout
        this process.</p>
        <h2>THE LAUNCH</h2>
        <p>The last phase is by far the longest. This is where we begin developing the website. Depending on
        the size and number of components, this could take a few weeks, up to several months. Along the way
        there will be limited amounts of communication between the developer and client. That's why the
        briefing is so important. Once this phase is complete, we will deploy the clients website and
        everything will be live!</p>
